 While following this project, I'm sure many have noted that boys will be boys. Yet I thinks it's fair to say that also girls will be girls! While back home in Finland, the boys have repaired their car and made preparations for their daredevil adventure, the girls in Nepal have designed and made splendid jewellery with their deft hands (and feet). No man could do the same. The other day I went to the women's refuge maintained by Princess Beads to dress the women for modelling shoots. As the women looked at themselves in a mirror, I realised how important it is for every woman to look beautiful. In this materialistic world we tend to think that beauty is what we see on the outside. Yet these women were extremely beautiful though the world hadn't offered its best for them. Above all, their beauty rises from the fact that they feel accepted and loved in their own community. We shot some commercial pictures for Princess Beads with a couple of girls. After overcoming their shyness and seeing a few beautiful shots, the girls transformed into gorgeous women who wore the jewellery they had made with pride. It was amazing to be there, to follow that transformation. Beauty certainly is not in the eye of the beholder but inside every girl. And what boys wouldn't do for girls - if necessary, they'll collect the jewellery from Nepal by car!
