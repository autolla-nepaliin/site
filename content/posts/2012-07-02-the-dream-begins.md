Phew, finally! The blog is almost ready and we can start writing updates about the progress of all the preparations. There’s things to change and add still but the main thing is that postings are now live. Our graphic designer/ programmer Lassi and I have been working on the blog the whole day so now it’s time to get some rest. Tomorrow I’ll try to write about everything that has happened so far!

If you don’t want to come here and check for updates, go like our Facebook page that we’ll also update tomorrow.
