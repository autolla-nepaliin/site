"Finland!"

There's no other way to express that amount of joy. It felt unbelievable to drive down the ferry ramp onto the solid bedrock of our homeland after everything we had experienced. Around us stood familiar buildings, the same old harbor, and the Finnish people living their busy lives. It was almost as incomprehensible to see Heffalump in the middle of it all as it was to see it months earlier driving on the bumpy streets of Nepal.

We couldn't have expected that our car would be recognized on the autumn streets of Helsinki, but as we drove around the center, we unexpectedly met several people who had been following our journey. At the Cathedral, in addition to a Radio City reporter, we exchanged news with several people who had been along for the ride remotely. A special mention to all of you!

After the customary jumping photos, it was time to say goodbye to Heffalump and to the travel companions of the last two months. Juho and Heikki turned their bow towards interviews waiting in Tampere, while I headed to Vantaa to begin the descent into a different everyday life. In the last weeks, normal life had been constant driving, processing filmed material in the back seat, and searching for a common language with the gas station cashier. The "everyday life" I was settling into didn't feel ordinary. There was something steady and permanent about it.

An incredibly huge thank you for the happy ending of the trip goes to the audience that followed our adventure. That means you! It was incredibly wonderful to see how much support, help, and encouragement we received from you during all the difficult situations, especially during the Mumbai car repair chaos. So I tip my hat to you, dear reader. Thank you! See you at the "final party" planned for Tampere in November!
