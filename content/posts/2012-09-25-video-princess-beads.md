Problem with video files is now gone and at last you can see how the beads are made in Nepal. Here\"s clip from Princess Beads where we purchased 5000 beads. You can soon buy them from www.storeofhope.fi but be patient. You will hear more about the beads in the next update.

Now I will edit a video from another village we visited and then I will continue making journey videos.
