I buried my grandpa today. I am his only grandchild and his only male descendant. We were very close.

Already when I started to plan this project I knew that grandpa would probably not see it come to reality. 

This funeral was one of those where death was a silent savior that led away the tired and suffering. This funeral was a good funeral for me as grandpa is in eternal rest now. 

Still death makes you stop and long for someone. 

When grandpa was young he was a good teacher at two small villages on the countryside. He did his job as a teacher well and rode his bike or moped from one place to another trying to make a positive impact also in other ways to the surrounding society. 

The Nepalese countryside teachers are in the same position now. 

May this project also be a tribute to you, Grandpa. May it enable the work of many good teachers like you in Nepal.
