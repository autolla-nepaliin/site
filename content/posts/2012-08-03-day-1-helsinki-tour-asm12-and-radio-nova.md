First day behind. We said hello to Misa and Rico and we exchanged some documents and gear. We visited Assebly (huge gaming event in Helsinki) and to our surprise we noticed that people didn't think we are totally crazy. Radio Nova called us and they are planning to follow our trip for the whole time. We are staying at my grandparents house and will continue in the morning towards Russian border.
