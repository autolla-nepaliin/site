We left in the morning towards Russian border. At the boarder we found out that the car'soriginal registration document was left in a copying machine. Three copies were with us but those weren't valid for the officers. In the end we got on the Russian side and picked up Rico from Vyborg. After this we continued our jorney towards St. Petersburg where we slept the second night.
