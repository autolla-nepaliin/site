To my pleasant surprise the publicity for Autolla Nepaliin (By car to Nepal) has worked surprisingly well even though I sent the first bulletins during the hottest (or should I say rainiest) summer holiday season. I received quite a few automatic replies where it said the recipient will read their emails later. Some hardworking journalists have been sitting at their desks, though, since Autolla Nepaliin has been presented in several media. Here is the timeline for the media coverage:


6.7. **Kangasalan Sanomat**, front page


29.7.** Aamulehti**, a comprehensive story about Juho in the Henkilöt (people)-pages


1.8. **Tamperelainen** will publish a story of the travellers both in the print and online version of the paper. **Ilta-Sanomat** will also publish an article of the journey in their online paper.


2.8. Travellers have set off. The articles of the journey were published in **Seurakuntalainen.fi** and the Finnish Foreign Ministry’s **global.finland**-websites.


3.8. **Radio Nova** decided to follow the guys journey. The first radio interview was before the border of Russia.


6.8. **Sipoon Sanomat** publishes an article


7.8. **Maailma.net** notes our project


8.8. **City.fi** publishes a comprehensive article in their online paper. **RV-magazine** also mentions the journey.


9.8. **Keskisuomalainen** tells about Autolla Nepaliin –project in their digital paper.


20.8. **Finland-Nepal-society** writes about the guys on their website.


In making the bulletins I have received helped from our proof reader Mari and my friend working as a real publicist, Krista. Thank you!


The biggest thanks goes to the Facebook fans of the Autolla Nepaliin –page. On the first day of August there were only 788 likes but now there are nearly 7500 of them. In addition the promotion photo of the travellers has been seen by over 67 000 users in Facebook. The enthusiasts have spread the word and even sent news story tips to papers.


Naturally the amount of fans has helped in getting sponsors. The support from the main sponsor will cover the travel costs and the profits from the advert sales will be directed to support the schooling of the most deprived children in Nepal through Fida International. Every like helps!
