Great news from Nepal! The reason of our project is to help the poorest people in Nepal. Thanks to our media attention second village we visited has now got a drilled well with hand pump where children can get pure drinking water. There has also been built two toilets next to school! One for boys and other for girls.

Village school's good roof has been kept but thin bambu walls have been torn down and replaced by brick walls. There's going to be two separate class rooms. Most of all due to our project we can hire second teacher to the school!

Here's a video from the second village. Starting from 2:58 forward: http://youtu.be/AHNLZS049JI
