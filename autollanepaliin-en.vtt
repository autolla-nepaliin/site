The caste system came
to Nepal between 300-800 A.D.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.240
Although it was officially
banned in 1963, -

00:28.280 --> 00:33.000
it continues to define the
role of people in society.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
In the weakest position are those
outside the system: the casteless.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
They are worthless in the eyes of others,
which forces many women into prostitution.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.480
This all began in the winter of 2009

01:05.480 --> 01:11.000
when I traveled in Southeast Asia,
filming people's lives.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I found myself in Nepal -

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
in the midst of breathtaking views, -

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
and an incredibly hospitable people.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
There I encountered some of
the most difficult life circumstances -

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
which I had ever seen.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
In Kathmandu I met residents
of a women's shelter -

01:33.000 --> 01:36.680
who searched for joy and balance -

01:36.680 --> 01:41.000
after others had driven them
to a dead end in their lives.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I also met children,
who have died by now, -

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
because they were born
into casteless families, -

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
into completely hopeless circumstances.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I had spent my childhood
in Central America.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.480
And from there I knew that poverty
does not make a person miserable, -

02:03.480 --> 02:08.000
any more than riches makes a person happy.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
The root of the problem is not money, -

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
but mans inclination to oppress others.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I began to dream, that
I could make a difference -

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
in the lives of these oppressed people.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Alleviating the oppression of the cast
system felt like such a distant dream -

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
so I decided to be rational and
begin somewhere practical and small.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I returned to Finland, got married, -

02:41.000 --> 02:45.480
started a business and
lived two years of my life.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
As an online entrepreneur
I had the opportunity -

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
to support residents of the women's shelter
by selling their jewelry in Finland.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.640
Now I only had to come
up with a way to bring -

02:59.680 --> 03:03.520
the jewelry to Finland and find buyers.

Here is the most important question for the trip:

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
[Day 1: 9431km to Nepal]
Should I wear these classic Ray-Bans, -

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
or these slightly more modern... Police?

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
In the end had pretty slim
resources starting out.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000

people who started doing.

When we first began to make "Kill Arman",

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
[Arman Alizad: Producer & TV personality]
we were two boys with a dream to create documentary -

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
about martial arts and
Kungfu masters around the world.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.240
Then when our idea went
through and production began, -

05:06.280 --> 05:10.000
we had no idea what to do.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
How the heck do we get into a Shaolin
temple and speak to a warrior monk?

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
I'll call him and say: "Hi, this is Arman,
can I come watch you kick about?"

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
If we had thought about everything,
and made detailed plans, -

05:25.000 --> 05:28.880
then I don't know if we
would ever have left, -

05:28.920 --> 05:33.000
because we would have been overwhelmed.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.360
And then it might not have ever happened, -

05:36.400 --> 05:40.000
because we would have started
thinking about all possible problems.

Driving to Nepal by car is no easy task.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
There are many hurdles along
the way, and unstable places.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
It is challenging from a traffic
stand point... and logistically.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I often think about how these enterprises
work out when one wants to do good.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
It must be something that
has been thought through.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
There must be a guarantee that the
project won't turn into a road to hell.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
As we know, the road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

06:20.480 --> 06:26.000
The project must be what is claimed,
doing good, and not get messed up.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
Traditionally charity is thought
of as an emotional thing.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
For me it has always
been a rational question.

06:35.560 --> 06:43.560
The inequality and foundation that I
have in life is an extreme privilege -

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
which results in a rational responsibility

[The "Dream Driven" planning video.]
My friends also had dreams

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
[The "Dream Driven" planning video.]
- and we decided to combine them all into one plan.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
My name is Mikael Hautala, and I am going
on this trip as a driver and photographer -

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
from Helsinki to Kathmandu.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Before the trip, when telling others
about what we were doing, -

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
older people tried to scare us asking:
"What is the point?"

07:28.000 --> 07:31.080
"You will die out there.
Something will happen.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.000
Your tires will bust... bla bla blaah."

07:34.000 --> 07:38.200
But when telling our age group,
everyone said:

07:38.240 --> 07:40.480
"That's cool! I want to come along!"

07:40.480 --> 07:45.000
Often the obstacle for people
to fulfill their dreams is that -

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
they let other people affect their
faith in the dream.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Many people told us that "Kill Arman"
will never been seen on TV.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
One producer said that I should have
stayed in the clothing business -

08:06.000 --> 08:08.480
and left producing to the producers.

08:08.480 --> 08:13.480
But we just had a crazy passion to do it,
and that is probably what kept it alive.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.480
The passion and love for the project
was greater than everything else.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.480
Everyone is responsible
for their own dreams.

08:20.480 --> 08:27.480

else will fulfill your dreams for you.

have driven there alone in a Kleinbus, -

then why couldn't three
fit young men travel -

09:01.520 --> 09:07.000

or at least the same distance?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000

highly or too lowly of ourselves.

it is just normal driving and living, .

not having driven the route before.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
There seemed to be large speed bump.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.480
Immediate reduction
of speed... a giant bang!

16:16.480 --> 16:21.000

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
I don't feel like speaking
to the camera right now...

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
But since we decided to film,
we are going do this filming thing.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
The passing lanes are quite short here,
approximately 400-500 meters.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.880
And I began passing a truck.

16:49.880 --> 16:57.880
The passing lane ended,
but it continued... striped.

17:00.000 --> 17:08.000
And I simply drove about 50 meters on it,
and there happened to be a police patrol.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
The threat was to end up before a Russian
court for driving in the wrong direction.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.640
The options were to either
wait for the decision -

17:20.640 --> 17:24.000
of the Russian court at
the police station -

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
or continue without my license
and skip the court session, -

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
which would mean I would be a wanted
person in Russia during our return trip.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.200
In panic I called Vadim
in St. Petersburg, -

17:36.200 --> 17:39.000
who explained the purpose of our
trip to the police in Russian.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.480
The police considered
the options for a while -

17:44.560 --> 17:48.160
and in the end decided
to not file any papers, -

17:48.200 --> 17:52.000
telling us to greet the
Dalai Lama and Bruce Lee.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Maybe I was just shocked -

17:55.000 --> 18:00.480
and couldn't think very much,
hoping for the best.

18:00.480 --> 18:07.000
At least it will be more interesting to
watch, but it certainly doesn't feel good.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, we got to continue, so on we go.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
We'll learn from this, that's for sure.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.040
It was cool when we started
doing this project -

18:25.080 --> 18:28.000
and a few months before leaving
our friends got excited.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.480
They helped us prepare the car,
and with sales and spreading the word etc.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.280
Then the radios began
calling, such as Radio Nova.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.000
The newspapers wrote about
us before heading out.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.440
And when we started out,
our Facebook likes rose.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.000
It felt like: "Yes, now we
have a good groove on."

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
We were excited and it was cool
when others were excited as well.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Once on the Russian side we started
receiving criticism on Facebook.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
Things like: "Hey, you are funding
a leisure trip to Asia with charity money."

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
But every expense that we had came either
from our own pockets or our own hard work.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
And everything that we sold,
such as advertising space etc -

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
went straight to Nepal
to further children's education.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Social media has come to stay.
It has its good and bad sides.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
It can no longer be avoided or removed.
It's a good thing.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
But then there is the completely unjustified
commenting behind anonymous aliases.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.600
That is a bad side of social media, -

19:32.640 --> 19:36.000
that often on the surface level those
opinions have the same value, -

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
even though in reality they're not.
Some are more justified than others.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
I fully understand that
the guys received criticism.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
Many people will ask if this is just some
trick by the guys to get themselves a trip.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Someone might want to go on a similar trip,
but has not achieved it.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
There are many motives: jealousy, anger,
the fear of being different.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
All these normal human feelings drive us
online to comment things.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Not only excitement, love and good
feelings, as we would wish of course.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
The entire sprectrum can be seen.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
3.5 hours now and 106 kilometers behind us.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.480
- St. Petersburg Moscow

20:22.480 --> 20:27.000
This highway.
- Yes. Three hours, 106 kilometers.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.800
Today we drove from St.
Petersburg to Moscow.

20:42.840 --> 20:47.000
700 kilometers and 14 hours in traffic.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Now I am worn out... get some sleep.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.120
Moscow is back there, and Kazan
is 800 kilometers ahead.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.040
We've been on the
road for an hour now.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
I took my foot off
the gas 3.3 kilometers ago.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
6 kilometers ago I took my foot
off the gas... and still going.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
[Day 7. The Russia-Kazakhstan border. Far from home]

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
We're getting Fluffy ready for the night.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Here is the current situation,
so plenty to do.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
The chemistry between us worked very well.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.560
Most of the time went by
with one person driving, -

22:30.600 --> 22:35.000
another reading the map,
and the third filming.

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
So there was no need for anything, there
were no factors that could create conflict.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
So this is where we sleep. Where are we?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
We're in Kazakhstan!

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
We are 50 meters from the Kazakhstan
border... at a gas station.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
I get to come between you again, right?

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
You are the smallest.
- Mm-hmm. That's enough for now. Good night.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
A Kazakh morning.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
We just drove 10 kilometers straight.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
Completely straight. I did not
need to touch the steering wheel.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Well maybe I did, but didn't need to.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
The roads look really good now...
We'll see.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
There Juho goes off to poop...
In the bushes.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
A flock of sparrows?
- Still like a cable.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.840
The fifth gas station
in this city that -

23:58.880 --> 24:03.040
we've tried to find that either
takes euros or a card.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.480
Get it?
- I got it exchanged.

24:06.480 --> 24:14.000
Now I have 7000 local money and for that
reason I thought I'd bring you some breakfast.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.480
These are some warm pastries.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.480
Did you know you're a good man Juho?
- Yes, I knew that.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.080
Driving over the endless
expanses of Kazakhstan -

24:36.120 --> 24:39.000
gave me time to think about the project.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Driving proved to be hard work, -

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
as did writing down our experiences
and keeping up our video blog.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.240
My own thoughts took me to
Nepal, and to the people -

24:52.280 --> 24:56.040
that had gotten me moving
in the first place.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Soon Rico and Mikael would
see the beauty of Nepal, -

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
but also the cruelty of the cast system.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.480
[Day 10. Balkhash lake, Kazakhstan, 4742km traveled]
To Finnish eyes the casteless are just poor people -

25:09.480 --> 25:14.000
[Day 10. Balkhash lake, Kazakhstan, 4742km traveled]
but in their own culture they are worth less than animals.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
When shaking the hand of a casteless
person, they are completely stunned, -

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
because normally touching a member
of the casteless is considered unclean.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
Thinking about the oppression for too long
would make one feel powerless and small.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
It was better to focus on the mission,
since at least we were doing something, -

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
even if it did not change
the whole world at once.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
The first camels of the trip!
I will run after them!

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
The first real mountain roads
of the trip are here.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
Welcome to this Folke West journey
to the plateaus of Kyrgyzstan.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Today a giant turtle has gotten
stuck on the windshield.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
So please be careful while
driving at these altitudes.

26:42.480 --> 26:49.480
Now we are in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan
which is a town of about 40,000 people -

26:49.480 --> 26:54.000
before going to China.

26:54.760 --> 26:59.480
This is so far the most
nerve wracking night, -

26:59.520 --> 27:04.400
because we are at a small gas station, -

27:04.400 --> 27:07.720
we don't know if this place closes.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.000
This country is significantly
poorer than Kazakhstan.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Yeah and this is a village
and people keep passing by.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
This is not some gas station by a major road,
where no one walks by during the night.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
So several things make this a bit nerve
wracking, but... that's it for now.

27:27.000 --> 27:35.000
This night's in the Lord's hands as well.
No one will rob us... maybe.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.200
The most important thing
is that we get rested.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.040
We'll wake up at 05:30 to make
it to the border on time.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
[Day 13. At-Bashi Plateau, Kyrgyzstan,
2011 meters above sea-level.]

27:52.480 --> 27:59.000
I just saw the most beautiful scenery
I have seen in a long long time.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
Whoa, it sends shivers up my spine
how the soul can rest in these views.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
[Day 13. Torugart Pass, Kyrgyzstan
3670 meters above sea-level.]

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
Found the bag!
- Nothing important, just the passports.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
There is a peak that rises
above 7900 meters.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Is that a lake?

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Basically Pohjanmaa...
Yes, very basic Pohjanmaa.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
[Day 14. Karakul-lake, China,
3900 meters above sea-level.]

29:23.480 --> 29:26.000
Juho's travel tips:

29:26.760 --> 29:34.760
[Chinese guide]
Don't buy... a scorpion inside a piece of amber.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
Don't buy a scorpion inside of amber,
even though it looks unique, -

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
because when you buy it 30 more appear,
which look exactly the same...

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
And you don't get your money back.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
And then you get quite annoyed.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Because?
- Because it...

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
How much did it cost?
- It cost a lot.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Plastic?
- Seems to be plastic...

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
We just arrived at the highest point
of this leg of the trip, 4100 meters.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.480
We won't go any higher today.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.840
After all these events
that we've had, -

30:20.840 --> 30:24.000
half an hour later
everything went smoothly.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
Now we're in China,
and I have faith that -

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
if this continues like this to the end,
we have nothing to worry about.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Finally the food came. We waited an hour.
- Longer!

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
We waited more than an hour!
- But we'll eat now... so see you.

31:08.480 --> 31:13.480
You have now puked all over the bathroom,
the toilet seat, the sink...

31:13.480 --> 31:17.000
Yes.
- Mikael's shoes and bed...

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Your own bed.
- It came so freaking fast.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.480
And there are pieces next to my bed.

31:23.480 --> 31:30.000
Really? I tried looking for water there...
and it gets stuck in my beard... -

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
When I try to block it like this
so that it doesn't come out...

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
It just spread everywhere
with an incredible speed.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.160
It was a little embarrassing
with the bathroom door...

31:45.160 --> 31:49.000
I was pounding it to try to get in, -

31:49.000 --> 31:53.480
and then I puke against it.
After everything is out...

31:53.480 --> 31:57.000
I realize that it is a sliding door.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Now we left the hotel. The Chinese border
control is 5 minutes from here.

32:05.000 --> 32:12.000
We were charged 10 yuan (1.28 Euros)
for Juho's puking in the night, -

32:12.000 --> 32:17.480
for the mess and a towel that
had been destroyed during cleaning.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.480
Quite cheap in the end.

32:19.480 --> 32:24.000
When we began climbing,
it went just as Wikipedia predicted, -

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Juho started getting altitude sickness.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
It made us think a little.

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
It is a little alarming when something
dangerous might be happening.

32:36.480 --> 32:42.000
Soon we will be at 4600 meters,
and I am in terrible shape because -

32:42.000 --> 32:45.640
my stomach was completely
emptied yesterday -

32:45.640 --> 32:49.000
and I haven't gotten
fluids to stay inside -

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
and the air is really thin.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
But soon we will begin descending, so this
should be it. Keep moving forward.

32:57.000 --> 33:05.000
[Day 15. Khunjerab Pass, China/Pakistan.
4713 meters above sea level.]

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Our VW can handle everything.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
I'm not always sure if I should wave,
when the guy has an AK-47 in his hands, -

34:12.000 --> 34:17.480
but he waved back smiling,
so maybe this time it was a good idea.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Could this be the Pakistani border station?

34:33.000 --> 34:40.000
I still feel quite terrible, but the reason
is no longer the lack of oxygen, -

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
so something else is wrong with me.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.400
But that was the least of
our worries at the moment, -

34:47.440 --> 34:51.000
because when we arrived at
the Pakistani customs area, -

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
we were told that
the Karakoram highway was closed.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this
Folke West tour of Pakistan.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Pakistan has some troubles at the moment, -

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
because the Karakoram highway has
been damaged for the past two years, -

35:07.000 --> 35:11.440
because in 2010 there was
some water damage, -

35:11.440 --> 35:15.000
resulting in 27 kilometers
of the road being cut off.

35:15.000 --> 35:23.000
- And that segment needs to be crossed
by boat... This is news to me.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
It means that first we must
drive an hour to Pasu...

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
- Where we spend the night.
And continue by a ferry...

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
- Which will take this car, and us...

35:36.000 --> 35:42.480
- 27 kilometer over the lake, and from there
we can get back on the Karakoram highway.

35:42.480 --> 35:49.000
- and the locals say the drive
from there is 20 hours.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
At least this isn't a rope bridge.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
The nauseous feeling has left now -

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
or it is no longer a problem,
but now I have a fever.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Zero energy.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
And I'm also pretty homesick.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
I miss my wife.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.280
I thought I'd have too much
to think about during the trip, -

36:54.320 --> 36:58.040
so that I wouldn't miss her.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
Juho had a few moments
when he was really homesick, -

37:06.200 --> 37:14.200
and it's hard when emotions overflow to
take hold of the situation rationally -

37:14.480 --> 37:21.000
that we're now here and nothing can be
done. We have to go on and that's it.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
A day forward after giving it some time -

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
then the mind wins and the emotions fade.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
Then the goal comes back into view
and we continue on the journey.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Those moments always come,
especially during long travels.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Feelings come to the surface.
Culture shock for example.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Sometimes after the honeymoon phase -

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
a reality check comes:
"What's going on here? It's rough."

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
"It is polluted here and the people
are in a hellish situation."

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
"There are so many poor people.
Why don't the rich do anything?"

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
But good conversations always helped.
It might be a little bit of depression.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Sometimes one gets worn out during travels,
and one gets a bit tired.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Those things need to be
dealt with, with friends.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
One can't make it alone, that is clear.
That's one thing I've learned.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
How are you feeling?

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Yesterday was terrible.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
I withdrew to sleep earlier,
and then got really homesick.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
I don't know...
Then I just cried myself to sleep.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
Mikael came and prayed for me at
some point that I would get well, -

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
and when I woke up in the morning: nothing.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.480
Food tasted good. Oh my goodness.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Can the boats be seen in the background?

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
Yes. Incredible, but true... With those
boats we need to cross 27 kilometers.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
There are these long beams that
we will drive the car on, horizontally.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
And then hope for the best.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
A little nerve wracking. We have
quite a bit of valuable stuff with us.

39:22.480 --> 39:26.000
This is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever seen. Completely crazy.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
We got a deal. It will cost
170 euros to cross the lake.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Expensive, but better than nothing.
We'll see what happens.

39:35.000 --> 39:41.000
The boat was completely
ridiculous. Just crazy.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
In itself it was unthinkable that -

39:46.000 --> 39:51.480
a large highway bridging two nations,
a world famous highways, -

39:51.480 --> 39:57.000
can just disappear for a stretch
of 30 kilometers, and become a lake.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
That in itself is quite strange.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.240
If in Finland the Third
Ring Road became a lake...

40:05.280 --> 40:10.000
We wouldn't use row boats
to tow cars across.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
That shouldn't be possible.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
I took the responsibility to load Fluffy.
As I crawled half a tire at a time, -

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
I could only think about
how bad this could end financially.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
I felt the boat tilt forward,
and thought: "This is it."

40:37.000 --> 40:41.480
"I'll deal with this debt
the entire next year."

40:47.000 --> 40:49.480
Oh wow!

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
We're at the end of the ferry ride, and
now the only nervous bit is the offloading.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
Supposedly last week a car
fell of a boat and that was it.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
Stepping outside of our comfort zone.
It's a fashionable phrase, but it is true.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
That is where the magic happens.
Where growth takes place.

42:03.000 --> 42:10.000
Usually people consider it a risk to
go wander around in unknown areas -

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
where one hasn't been before,
doing something one hasn't done before.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
But it is the only and best way
to do a new refreshing thing.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Just step on it!

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
The mountain has come onto the road,
and now two tractors are cleaning it up.

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
We'll see if this takes a moment,
day, or week for them to clear it.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Cleared!

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
362.
- 362!

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Looks good. Looks good.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
I hope things turn out well.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
There was a bridge.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
...not anymore.

44:00.480 --> 44:05.480
We're in Gilgit.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.480
Did you say 1,400, or?

44:10.480 --> 44:17.000
Yes. 1,400 Rupees (12 Euros)
per night for three people -

44:17.000 --> 44:23.080
and it looks pretty good. Cheapest so far.
Okay, lets get packing.

44:28.480 --> 44:34.000
When we arrived in Gilgit, the local
police chief asked to speak with us.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.840
The victory feeling after
the ferry crossing faded,

44:37.880 --> 44:42.040
when we realized Pakistan was Pakistan.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
So, we were just told that the road
to Islamabad is somehow dangerous.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
Something happened yesterday
and now no one has gotten through.

45:14.000 --> 45:20.480
We could not speak about
the "what if?"-question there.

45:20.480 --> 45:28.000
We attempted to speak to the camera.
All three of us went in front of a mirror.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
We never had a shot with the three
of us drivers at the same time.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
We went in front of the mirror
to talk about our feelings, -

45:37.000 --> 45:41.200
but it's a load of crap
when Finnish men try to -

45:41.240 --> 45:45.480
speak about their feelings
as they're happening.

45:45.480 --> 45:50.000
How did that conversation make you feel?

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
You are still laughing, but I bet -

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
even Juho will soon realize
how fucked up things are.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
I wonder what we just discussed.
"No one bombs anyone here."

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
No one has bombed anything!

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
We don't know what has happened.

46:10.000 --> 46:18.000
They were saying that
the road had been targeted.

46:19.000 --> 46:27.000
The only thing I picked up was that
there had been a terrorist attack.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
A terrorist attack that claimed lives.

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
It sounded like a bridge
was blown up or something.

46:37.000 --> 46:44.000
The locals won't even
let us go to Islamabad... yet.

46:44.000 --> 46:51.000
The feelings were primarily some
mix of survival and a state of fear.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
Or more of a panic.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
I primarily thought that
we need to get out of here -

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
before things really get life threatening.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.080
As an extreme optimist
and positive person Juho -

47:10.120 --> 47:14.000
seemed completely oblivious
to the situation.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
That people are really
being killed around us.

47:17.040 --> 47:20.000
And that we were stuck in the city.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
It didn't break our chemistry -

47:26.000 --> 47:34.000
but dealing with Juho
began feeling like work.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
I cannot comprehend how someone can
be so relaxed, as if on vacation, -

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
when we're stuck in Gilgit
because of a terrorist attack.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
I don't understand.

47:48.000 --> 47:55.000
I don't know about death.
Thinking about it now...

47:55.000 --> 48:03.000
I have never been so close to a real
possibility that I could have died -

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
as was the threat in Pakistan.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.160
Should we risk driving
the last 650 kilometers, -

48:13.200 --> 48:18.000
where there might be
terrorists on the road.

48:18.000 --> 48:25.000
Is the risk worth it, because
we'd leave our wives alone.

48:26.480 --> 48:34.000
I'm going to fly out of Gilgit... I'll take
the fastest route out of this country.

48:34.480 --> 48:40.000
I didn't like the idea of coming
to Pakistan, and now I like it even less.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
This is completely ridiculous.

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
Rico. Tomorrow we'll go to Islamabad
first thing in the morning.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Watch me go.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
There weren't many options.
We'll continue onward.

48:55.000 --> 49:02.000
We had to keep moving forward since
I didn't have a visa back to China.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.480
[Day 17. Gilgit, Pakistan, 650km from the mountains]
Juho what is happening?

49:04.480 --> 49:07.000
[Day 17. Gilgit, Pakistan, 650km from the mountains]
I'm cleaning the van.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
[Day 17. Gilgit, Pakistan, 650km from the mountains]
Because we're getting two Norwegian stowaways.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
Norwegian stowaways?
- Yes, they have them here in Northern Pakistan.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
So we can leave tomorrow?
- Yes!

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Oh wow.
- Only delayed by one day.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
What does Rico think about this?

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
I feel safer with those
extra human shields.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
If things get screwed up I might get away.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.560
It was probably the biggest
fears of mine, -

49:41.000 --> 49:49.000
- that I make it fine, but something
happens to one of the other drivers.

49:51.080 --> 49:58.560
How could I live with it, if one of my
companions falls into a lake in Pakistan?

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
We left Gilgit in the morning,
because we could. Yay.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.480
But when we turned the engine on
we noticed a leakage of yellow fluid.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.480
Our power steering is busted.

50:44.480 --> 50:52.000
It turned out that the oil had
leaked from the power steering...

50:52.000 --> 50:59.000
We couldn't do anything
but let it bust along the way.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
Because we simply had to
get out of this country.

51:03.000 --> 51:10.000
You can hear our power steering
dying with a terrible squeaking.

51:10.000 --> 51:16.000
We were driving on beautiful roads,
but we couldn't focus on the views -

51:16.000 --> 51:19.800
because a few days ago
terrorists killed -

51:19.840 --> 51:24.000
over 20 people on these roads,
including women and children.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
We came on Karakoram Highway North.
We're headed on Karakoram Highway South.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.480
And on that road 20 people
were killed the other day.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
I'm quite scared.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
[Day 17. Jaglot, Pakistan. 500km from the mountains]
- Louder? I'm pretty damn scared.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
[Day 17. Jaglot, Pakistan. 500km from the mountains]
We don't know what's ahead, -

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
and have everything to lose.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
Let us hope we get out alive from
this country. I'll never come back.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
It's the first time I wish I had
a gun in the glove compartment.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.320
When the other guy has a gun, -

52:04.320 --> 52:07.480
it would be good to have something
to defend oneself with.

52:07.480 --> 52:15.000
So we'll get extra protection in the car.
The next 10 kilometers is a dangerous area.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.480
I had a man with
an assault rifle by my side.

52:19.480 --> 52:23.000
The broken power steering
made steering difficult.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
The 100 meter cliffs by the road
didn't alleviate the tension either.

52:28.000 --> 52:36.000
At the previous police checkpoint we got
rid of the cop who sat on Mikael's seat.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
But I don't know if this is a safer area -

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
because now we have a police car
behind us with three armed police.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
When we realized the boxes
on the cars were caskets -

52:49.000 --> 52:56.000
we began to count the kilometers, hoping
we'd get out of the mountains by nightfall.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
It's quite crazy here in Pakistan.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
From the right, left, front, back,
top and bottom... and who knows where.

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
Animals, children, cars, mopeds.
You name it.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Abbottabad!

53:28.000 --> 53:32.480
We were unfazed by
the arrival to Abbottabad, -

53:32.480 --> 53:38.000
where Osama Bin Laden was killed,
because we were out of the mountains.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.680
The next day we could drive
all the way to India.

53:42.720 --> 53:46.040
We would not return to Pakistan.

53:46.480 --> 53:50.000
Welcome to India. India. India.

54:01.480 --> 54:05.480
That counted!
- That was the second hit.

54:05.480 --> 54:10.000
Who's driving?
- Who do you think?

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
[Day 21. Butwal, Nepal, over 9000 km driven]
We're in Nepal.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
[Day 21. Butwal, Nepal, over 9000 km driven]
Ta-da-da-daaa!

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Welcome to Nepal!
- La-la-la-la-laa.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
Not much happened today but we had fun.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
[Day 22. Shreenagar Village, Nepal]

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
We're walking to Shreenagar village.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
Before continuing to Kathmandu
I showed Rico, Mikael, and our followers -

55:13.000 --> 55:16.480
the school which we had raised money for.

55:16.480 --> 55:20.000
We had to walk a good while
to Shreenagar village -

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
because society had driven the casteless
out from the bigger villages.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.560
The village had changed
in the past three years.

55:28.560 --> 55:32.000
The school was bigger
with twice the children.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
It was nice to think that
the few thousand euros -

55:35.000 --> 55:41.000
that we had raised in advertising,
could help the education of these children.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Bye bye!

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Front page.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
We got on the front page. Yesterday we had
a reporter with us at the village -

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
and now we're on the front page
in a local newspaper.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
We're at the finish line.
There! 400 meters.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Na-na-na-na-na Batman!

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
What's happening? Where are we!?
- The finish line!

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Rico, where are we?
- The sauna.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
Misa had flown to Kathmandu, and he would
take Mikael's place for the return trip.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
We had to figure out how to get Fluffy
and the jewelry back to Finland -

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
without driving through Pakistan.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
We arrived at Princess Beads,
after an extremely long journey.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
There is jewelry of all colors.

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
So many colors that a Finnish man's
brain goes like this...

58:00.000 --> 58:08.000
So many colors and shapes etc, but you
ladies can find yourselves suitable ones.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.480
Misa seems to be modeling with a few.

58:11.480 --> 58:15.000
He is a little too excited
about this jewelry.

58:15.000 --> 58:23.000
Just missing a few, and tomorrow we'll
get our order loaded into the van.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
And then we'll head back
to Finland. Whoohoo!

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Now we are going to
the Finnish consulate in Kathmandu.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
There will be a press conference about us.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
It almost got out of control in Kathmandu.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.360
All of a sudden all of
Nepal was reporting about -

58:48.360 --> 58:52.000
young men from Finland coming
to help the casteless.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
The small creek started
growing into a river.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.880
Helping the women of
shelter opened the doors -

58:57.920 --> 59:01.000
to the larger dream of shaking oppression.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.640
When we found out that
Nepal's largest telephone operator -

59:04.640 --> 59:08.000
wanted to speak with us -

59:08.000 --> 59:10.480
we couldn't wait to hear
what they had to say.

59:10.480 --> 59:14.000
An incredible meeting with Ncell.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
They will support this project
for many years to come.

59:20.000 --> 59:27.760
[Mikael singing]

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
What's in the trunk?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I don't know.
- Look.

59:40.000 --> 59:47.000
I'm expecting a flock of goats.
- Are those goat heads?

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
Hey! Jewelry. Lots of jewelry.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.000
For the surprise of the day,
Rico got plane tickets to Finland.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.480
Originally when planning the trip
we thought it would be 5 weeks.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.000
That is how much time
I had allotted for the trip.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
School had started for me in Finland
and I was worried what would happen.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
How long would the trip back take?
I had to then weight the options.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
We discussed with Juho if they
could make the trip back without me.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
They could, so I decided
to fly back to Finland.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Bye bye.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
This is beginning to get
quite rough for me.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I just got the feeling all of a sudden.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Mikael left, which was planned.
Rico left, which was a surprise.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.080
I was homesick in Pakistan already.
To the point of tears.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
This doesn't help the situation,
seeing others get to go home.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But I'm not in absolute agony here.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
We'll get to Finland eventually, but
it just doesn't feel that great now.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.000
We were stuck in Kathmandu
with the car and jewelry.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.360
I had placed a security of 7500 euros to -

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.000
the Swedish Driver's Union
to obtain Fluffy's passport.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.480
The security would be released,
once the car was back in Finland.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:10.000
I had borrowed the money, so I would be
in a mess if we did not make it back.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000
We dared not go back to Pakistan.
Tibet in the North was closed off.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And we could not go around
the Himalayas in the East.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
We finally found a shipping firm
in Mumbai, India -

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
that was willing to ship Fluffy to Iran.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We set off knowing that each kilometer
was a step closer to home.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
It was a risk with just the two of us.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.480
We began to doubt that we could make it.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.000
We began asking if someone from Finland
wanted to come as a third driver.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Can they get to India or Nepal?
If so, how?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000
The plan was still the same.
To go through Mumbai in India.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
That was the direction.
We had to go through India.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Today we got the car fixed.
We'll also get a third driver in Dubai.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Looks like we'll head out tomorrow.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
[Day 34, Kathmandu, Nepal
2317 kilometers and 7 days to the ship.]

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.480
We're going to Finland.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Misa is behind the wheel
for the first time.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
This is going great.
- Stop, police.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The sticker is on the passport.
Misa and I are officially out of Nepal.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
The whole process, with the guys driving
and with me supposed to be there, -

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:05.680
it was a little disappointing that I
couldn't be there sharing those moments.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.480
Behind me is Taj Mahal. It's an incredible
sight in the evening sun.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000
[Day 36. Agra, India. 1414 km and 5 days to the ship]

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
We left at dawn from Jaipur toward Udaipur.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I just drove 325 kilometers here in India
and I don't want to any more.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Luckily after tomorrow
we don't need to drive in India.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:14.000
It's just so draining.
Anything can appear on the road.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:22.760
Cows, dogs, pigs, camels, people, tractors.
From behind the bushes.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Something could really happen here
because the speeds go up to 100 km/h.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And an accident at 100 km/h
is quite a big thing.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I dreamed of the winning gold at
the Vancouver Olympics for a long time.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.840
After the first round I
was within my goals.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.000
I was the fastest and led the competition.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
In the last turn of the second competition,
I made a simple mistake.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I almost fell. Got driven into another
lane, and dropped to fifth place.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Crossing the finish line
I felt like it wasn't real.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It felt unreal.
I wondered when I could retry.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
This couldn't be it.
It was a weird feeling.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I hadn't experienced very big
disappointments in my career so far.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.480
But this felt huge,
as if everything was crushed.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.000
I'd wasted four years of hard work.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
It really put me in a tough spot.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
What gave me strength to over come it was -

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
realizing that sports isn't everything,
and that I had another chance.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I'll move on from here. This will make
me a stronger athlete and person.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
As you may have noticed,
we were in a wreck.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Fluffy is in terrible shape.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I have no idea if it can be fixed.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
We're in Udaipur and
Mumbai is 700 kilometers away.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:23.680
Transportation is being arranged.
We'll travel on the back of a truck.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
No need to drive in India anymore.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000
When the accident happened,
it made me think -

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.000
if somehow it could have been
prevented with me there.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Maybe if the drivers had been
switched every few hours.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
We came to the police station,
and they kindly contacted someone -

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
who will arrange a truck and crane.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.640
We'll load Fluffy on the truck -

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.000
and then ride in it to Mumbai.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
The one driver will drive
20 hours straight.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I don't know if we'll be in another
accident while sitting in a wrecked car.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
This is proof that things
could always be worse.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It wasn't a fun thought
to drive 14 hours to Mumbai -

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:48.000
but now we're sitting 20 hours on the back
of a truck, in our car. Not more fun.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Two hours behind us.
- Four hours now.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Sixth hour.
- Hour 20.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.000
We're stuck in Mumbai traffic.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000
[Day 40. Mumbai, India. 64 km and 1 day to the ship]
The last time we ate was breakfast 28 hours ago.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It would be nice to be there already.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I miss my wife.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
This is where we're staying in Mumbai.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It is nice to have kind people who
have arranged this place for us.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000
It's safe. We have AC
and everything we need.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Though we do have one big need...

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.120
When young men haven't
showered in 48 hours -

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.400
and have been in the same clothes.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.000
I have never been this dirty
or smelled this terrible before.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
In the worst case fixing
Fluffy might not be worth it.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It might not be financially tenable.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I'm not really sure.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Tomorrow will bring its solutions...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But if I could get some
warm food, bathe and sleep, -

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and maybe contact home,
then I'd be happy.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Pizza!

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I came to check what they've
accomplished with the van in a day.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.680
When I finally got a hold of
the people at Volkswagen, -

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.000
then things began to move forward -

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
but we're still on
an extremely tight schedule.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Third day of repair. Let's see if
they got the part numbers for me.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.040
The main problem with
fixing Fluffy was that -

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.400
the VW Transporter had never
been brought to India.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.400
The closest parts were in Turkey.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.240
We were in the largest
Volkswagen workshop, -

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.000
but the mechanics saw
the Transporter for the first time.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The blueprints and part numbers
had to be figured out from Germany.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Miraculously the frame was fine. We knew
that the motor and gearbox were fine.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.000
This part must be changed on both sides.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Soon we'll get a list of the parts -

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
and we'll post them on Facebook in case
someone has some of them laying around.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It was an incredible hassle.
Two or three days and hundreds of phone calls.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Tens of people and car mechanics -

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.640
questions like: What is wrong? -

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.000
What parts need to be
bought and from where?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000
We were in a hurry because there was a
ship from Mumbai to Iran only once a week.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.000
So a days delay could mean a week
longer stay in India for the boys.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.480
We had already been on pause
with nothing moving forward.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.480
We constantly lost followers.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.480
If nothing happens in a week
people lose interest.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:21.000
That was also a fear. We had to
get going and get the ball rolling.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
An evening behind us.
Let's see what the boys have done.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
They have accomplished quite a bit.
If we're lucky we'll catch tomorrow's ship.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Woke up to a Mumbai morning.
- Cockadoodledoo!

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:42.000
I came here in the morning
to see if things are ready -

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
and it looks pretty bad, so maybe we
won't get home a week early after all.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I had already hoped for so long
that we'd get home a week earlier.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:07.680
We'll let the mechanics confirm it but it's
not looking like we'll get home early.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:18.080
Thanks everyone who fought so hard for us
to be able to get on this week's ship.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
It would have been important.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.480
Seeing Juho there...
I wondered how he had endured.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.000
He unrelentingly went through
each day and gave it his all -

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
despite feeling so bad.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Okay bye.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
So... a part is missing on top of it all.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000
[Day 51. Mumbai, India.
4 days to the third ship]

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Just let it all out.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
[Day 54. Mumbai, India. 1 day to the third ship]

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.480
[Day 54. Mumbai, India. 1 day to the third ship]
After three weeks of sickness, battles with customs, -

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:34.000
and three ships having passed,
things were close to ready.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Let's go!

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.120
We don't have time to stay
here and watch it get sealed, -

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.480
because we need to catch our flights.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:17:00.000
I hope to see Fluffy again. And hopefully
it doesn't flip in the container.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
When I heard that Juho was asking
around about getting another driver -

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I immediately felt that I must go along.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.000
The first day in Dubai. Today we need
to get Misa and myself an Iranian visa.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.000
But most importantly we found
a famous sight: A Finnish Heikki.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Hi!
- Hi!

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Hello.
- Hello.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
We got to the port 5 hours ago -

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and now we've gotten on
the ferry and had some food.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
We must sleep this night on these benches.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.000
In Iran we were stuck in a small port city,
before Fluffy was freed from the container.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
First time turning Fluffy on since Mumbai.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
[Day 71. Bandar Abbas, Iran. 7925 km to Finland]

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.000
How is it so quiet?
I remember it being a terrible screamer.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It has lights as well.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000
All our worries about Iran had dissipated
during the two weeks of waiting.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Iranians are the embodiment
of hospitality and friendliness.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
We were brought pomegranates and
grapes from moving motorbikes.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Being guests, the toll roads
did not charge us.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.320
And at the regulated gas
stations someone always -

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.480
shared from their filling right
with a smile on their face.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:11.000
We would have enjoyed the country more,
if we hadn't been in a hurry home.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
[Day 75. Göreme, Turkey. 4807km to Finland]

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You probably know
the expression: breathtaking.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I literally couldn't breathe normally.
This was such an unbelievable sight.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I can't explain it. Maybe you can
see how much I'm enjoying this.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I hope you can.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.360
When we finally crossed the
Bosporus strait and were in Europe, -

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.000
nothing could hold us back.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
There would no longer be troubles with
customs, late ships, lost containers, -

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
ferries or terrorists causing a stir.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:19.000
If the car broke down in the EU,
we would not be fined.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.000
There was only free paved road ahead
and we would be in Finland.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
[Day 79. Belgrade, Serbia. 3128 km to Finland]
Every meter took us closer to home.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
We had shared stories
on blogs and Facebook -

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000
from the hot air balloons in Turkey,
to the incredibly friendly people of Iran -

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
but the project had taken so long,
that people had lost interest.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
We remained a medium sized phenomenon.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
A few advertisers had still joined
in Dubai, but we knew this was it.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
The project would not longer reach new
people, or raise more money to Nepal.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I hadn't seen my wife in 2.5 months.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.480
I hadn't checked my email,
or cooked my own food.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:21.760
I was a tired traveler. Driving north,
autumn come as if speeded up.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.480
We organized a final party for the project,
because we felt it was time.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.440
It was great to see so many
interested people in one place, -

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.480
but for those involved
the night was a relief.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:16.000
We could return to our
normal day to day lives.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
We had given our all, and this was it.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Or so we had thought!

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.440
I was invited to speak
about the project -

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.000
to high schools and
universities around Finland.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Inspired by our story, some went on
to dream about charity work.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And some even completed their own projects.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000
We realized, that the more people hear
our story, the more would go out and dream.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
We went to crowd fund a film,
and the public responded positively.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
When you follow your dreams,
surprising things happen.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Using their profit the Princess Home
shelter has built a children's home.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:16.000
The Store of Hope web store got a great
businesswoman to look after it.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Store of Hope now employs more
people in third world countries -

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000
having expanded in its first year
with product lines in Nepal and Kenya.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.320
The most surprising turn in
our dream was the Nepalese -

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.000
participation in developing the
villages for the casteless.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
We couldn't even have
dreamed of anything like it.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
The Nepalese government built walls and a
well for a school, and employed a teacher.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.040
A local rich land owner
gave the village the land -

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:53.000
on which a school had
previously been unlawfully.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
The biggest thing was
the partnership with Ncell, -

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.480
which resulted in the building
of two complete school centers -

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.040
with toilets, yards, and walls.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
These were such great things,
that we had to see them for ourselves.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000
[Shreenagar Village, Nepal. February 5th, 2014]

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.480
We just arrived with Mikael -

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.680
and we've tried to speak
about technical things -

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.040
so that our emotions don't well up.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Luckily we have technical
things to talk about.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It makes a Finnish man's life
significantly easier.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
The kids have uniforms...

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And a school I guess.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
They're wondering why I'm crying,
when this should be a positive thing.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Too many emotions to recognize.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Two years ago I could never have believed
what this project would achieve.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.280
Walking here and
seeing the school.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.000
I got to touch the first brick.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I thought about how much work this
has been carrying all this here.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And we've been a part of it.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
That this school is here.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Right here in this casteless village.
Nowhere else, but here.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.000
There are now 125 students
who can go to school.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Four teachers. Here are three classrooms,
and there are two in the old school.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I don't think anyone close by has as beautiful
of a school as the casteless do here.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Namaste.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.000
Namaste.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
It's crazy how just a few balls
can stir up such a commotion.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Five balls. The whole village is here
and balls are flying everywhere.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Look a dog.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
"I saw you in a dream."

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
"As you ran toward the plateau."

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
"You carried the fear in secret."

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.000
"I remained standing."

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
"I crossed the border."

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
"And hoped that maybe -"

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
"I could forget the pain."

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.480
"I fell asleep with open eyes."

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:32.880
"If I gave my hand, would you hold it?"

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:42.000
"If I gave you time,
would you trust me to stay?"

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
"If I looked in your eyes,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
- and touched you,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:59.000
- would you believe that I loved you?"

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:27.000
"As I lay awake, I see your eyes."

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:36.000
"A look that slowly fades
into the darkest night."

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
"I will return."

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
"I'll go even though I'm afraid."

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:54.000
"Through the deserts, I will return."

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:03.000
"If I gave my hand, would you hold it?"

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000
"If I gave you time,
would you trust me to stay?"

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
"If I looked in your eyes,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
[Shreenagar village, The old school]
- and touched you,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
- would you believe that I loved you?"

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:39.000
"If I gave my hand, would you hold it?"

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.000
"If I gave you time,
would you trust me to stay?"

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.000
"If I looked in your eyes,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
- and touched you,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:06.000
- would you believe that I loved you?"

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:15.000
"Would you believe that I loved you?"

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.520
Resulting from this project, two new
school buildings were built in Nepal, -

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:40.040
and buildings for three other
schools were completed.

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.200
Much to the surprise of the
boys, this crowd funded movie -

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:47.480
made it into theaters and
was shown around Finland.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:51.200
The proceeds enabled the building
of another school in Nepal -

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.040
and the provision of health check-ups
and medicine for 4500 children.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.000
When a dream is born
I feel that something -

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.480
inside me is unconsciously above all else.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:17.000
It's something that keeps me awake
and drives me forward.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.480
A dream is something
one is ready to work for.

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.480
Many people confuse dreams and wishes.

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.000
The difference is simple.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
A wish is something that
one is not ready to work for, -

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
but a dream is something one
is prepared to work for.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
A dream is what you think, your goals, -

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000
what you want to happen in the future.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000
It is something that I have no
peace about until it is completed.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:03.400
My biggest dream was
to create "Kill Arman" -

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.480
a documentary about martial arts.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.480
It was something that bothered
me for five years.

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.120
For me it is constantly
in my head, -

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.040
and that is why I'm encouraged
to take steps toward it.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
How does a dream differ from a wish?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I don't know... is there a difference?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.480
I like the idea that one can see
life as full of possibilities -

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.000
to see life filled with ideas.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
That is what this is all about.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
